ðŸ“˜ Decision Tree Classifier and Regressor

Welcome to the Decision Tree Machine Learning Project!
This repository contains an easy-to-understand, practical demonstration of building and tuning Decision Tree models for both classification and regression tasks using scikit-learn.

ðŸ§¬ What is a Decision Tree?

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that works for classification and regression by learning simple decision rules from data features.

Each internal node: a "decision" on a feature.

Each leaf node: a prediction outcome.

Flow from root to leaf: model's decision-making process.

It's like asking a series of yes/no questions to guess the answer!

ðŸ§  How It Works: Theory and Math

Classification Trees:

Try to split data into "pure" groups using metrics like Gini Impurity or Entropy.
Gini = 1 - sum(p_i^2)

Example: "Is Age < 30?" splits into two branches.

Regression Trees:

Splits minimize variance (MSE: Mean Squared Error) in target variable.

Gini Impurity (for classification)
MSE = (1/n) * sum((y_i - y_hat)^2)


Where  is the probability of class  at a node.

Mean Squared Error (for regression)



Where  are actual and  are predicted values.

ðŸ“ˆ Why Decision Trees?

Easy to understand and visualize

No need for feature scaling

Can handle both numerical and categorical data

Can model non-linear relationships

Can easily overfit (so pruning/tuning is important)
